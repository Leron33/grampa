GRAph Matching by Pairwise eigen-Alignments (GRAMPA)

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the graph matching method developed in "Spectral Graph Matching and Regularized Quadratic Relaxations I & II" (2019) by Zhou Fan, Cheng Mao, Yihong Wu and Jiaming Xu. A short version of the two papers appearead in ICML 2020 https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1778-Paper.pdf

**GRAMPA_AS** folder contains the code to evaluate the performance of GRAMPA on matching autonomous network systems.

**GRAMPA_comparison** folder contains the code to compare GRAMPA with the existing graph matching methods. 

**GRAMPA_rec** folder contains the code to evaluate the performance of GRAMPA on Shrec computer vision dataset.

**grampa.m** contains the matlab code for GRAMPA.
